# Pytorch-Fundamentals
Zero - ðŸ§ 

This repo covers the basics of Pytorch from scratch. 
I documented the basics of Pytorch in this repo while I was learning it. 

## Tensors in Pytorch (Fundamentals)
The pytorch fundamentals notebooks covers mostly the following topics:
- Creating tensors
- Tensor datatypes
- Tensor attributes (information about tensors)
- Manipulating tensors
- Matrix multiplication
- Finding the min, max, mean and sum
- Reshaping, viewing and stacking
- Squeezing, unsqueezing and permuting
- Selecting data (indexing)
- PyTorch and NumPy

##  PyTorch Workflow
- Introduction to PyTorch Workflow
- Getting setup
- Creating a dataset with linear regression
- Creating training and test sets (the most important concept in ML)
- Creating our first PyTorch model
- Discussing important model building classes
- Checking out the internals of our model
- Making predictions with our model
- Training a model with PyTorch (intuition building)
- Setting up a loss function and optimizer
- PyTorch training loop intuition
- Running our training loop epoch by epoch
- Writing testing loop code
- Saving/loading a model
- Putting everything together

Hey there! I'm a new Pytorch user.

This repo is a work in progress. Hence, it will be updated regularly.
