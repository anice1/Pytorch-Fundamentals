# Pytorch-Fundamentals
Zero - ðŸ§ 

This repo covers the basics of Pytorch from scratch. 
I documented the basics of Pytorch in this repo while I was learning it. 

## Tensors in Pytorch (Fundamentals)
The pytorch fundamentals notebooks covers mostly the following topics:
- Creating tensors
- Tensor datatypes
- Tensor attributes (information about tensors)
- Manipulating tensors
- Matrix multiplication
- Finding the min, max, mean and sum
- Reshaping, viewing and stacking
- Squeezing, unsqueezing and permuting
- Selecting data (indexing)
- PyTorch and NumPy
